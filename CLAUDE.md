## Development Commands

### Running the Bot

```bash
# Run in development mode
go run .

# Build the binary
go build -o yordamchi-dev-bot .

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy
```

### Environment Setup

The bot requires a `.env` file with:

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
BOT_MODE=webhook
APP_PORT=8090
DB_TYPE=sqlite
```

**Bot Modes:**
- **Polling mode**: Set `BOT_MODE=polling` (for development)
- **Webhook mode**: Set `BOT_MODE=webhook` (for production)

**Database Options:**
- **SQLite**: Set `DB_TYPE=sqlite` (default, for development)
- **PostgreSQL**: Set `DB_TYPE=postgres` (requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)

## Architecture

### Core Structure

- `main.go` - Application entry point, loads config, initializes database, and starts bot
- `bot.go` - Bot implementation with webhook handling, message processing, and database integration
- `handlers/` - Command handlers and configuration management
  - `config.go` - Configuration loading and random content functions
  - `commands.go` - Command handler implementation (currently duplicates bot.go logic)
- `database/` - Database layer with multi-provider support
  - `db.go` - SQLite implementation with user management and activity tracking
  - `postgres.go` - PostgreSQL implementation for production
- `config.json` - Bot configuration including messages, jokes, and quotes
- `.claude/docs/` - Comprehensive learning documentation (4-week curriculum)

### Key Components

- **Bot struct**: Main bot implementation with token, URL, config, database, and handler
- **Update/Message structs**: Telegram API message types
- **Config struct**: Configuration data from config.json
- **DB struct**: Database abstraction layer supporting SQLite and PostgreSQL
- **User/UserActivity structs**: Data models for user management and activity tracking
- **CommandHandler**: Modular command processing (handlers/commands.go)

### Dependencies

## üîÑ Development Rules

### Progressive Implementation
When implementing features from the documentation:

1. **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Follow documented weeks progressively (Week 1 ‚Üí Week 2 ‚Üí Week 3 ‚Üí Week 4)
2. **Commit After Each Part**: After completing each significant feature or day's implementation, commit changes before continuing
3. **Sync with Documentation**: Ensure implemented code matches the documented patterns and explanations

### Learning Documentation Generation
For each implementation step:

1. **Create Learning Files**: Generate Uzbek language code explanations and definitions in `learn/` directory
2. **File Structure**: Create separate files for each major concept or implementation step
3. **Content Focus**: Include Go concepts, programming patterns, and code explanations in Uzbek
4. **Progressive Learning**: Build upon previous concepts with each new file

### Example Learning File Structure:
```
