## 🎯 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Reflected in current codebase

**What you'll build:**
- Basic Telegram bot with webhook handling
- Command routing system  
- JSON configuration management
- Core commands (/start, /help, /ping, /hazil, /iqtibos)

**Files implemented:**
- `main.go` - Application entry point
- `bot.go` - Core bot functionality  
- `handlers/config.go` - Configuration management
- `handlers/commands.go` - Command handling
- `config.json` - Bot configuration data

### Phase 2: External Integration (Week 2) 
**Status**: 📖 **DOCUMENTED** - Ready for implementation

**What you'll build:**
- GitHub API integration for repository info
- Stack Overflow API for programming Q&A
- HTTP client service with proper error handling
- Caching layer with Redis
- Rate limiting for API calls

### Phase 3: Database & Architecture (Week 3)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Reflected in current codebase  

**What you'll build:**
- SQLite and PostgreSQL database support
- User registration and activity tracking
- Database abstraction layer
- Environment-based configuration
- Statistics and analytics

**Files implemented:**
- `database/db.go` - SQLite implementation
- `database/postgres.go` - PostgreSQL support  
- Updated `main.go` - Database integration
- Updated `bot.go` - User management

### Phase 4: Production Features (Week 4)
**Status**: 📖 **DOCUMENTED** - Advanced patterns ready for implementation

**What you'll build:**
- Advanced command architecture with interfaces
- External API services (weather, crypto)
- Caching and performance optimization
- Security middleware and validation
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Monitoring and observability

## 🏗 Current Architecture

## 🛠 Development Commands

Based on your `CLAUDE.md`, here are the key commands:

```bash
# Development
go run .                    # Run bot in development
go mod tidy                # Install dependencies

# Environment Setup  
# Create .env file with:
BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
BOT_MODE=webhook           # or polling for dev
APP_PORT=8090
DB_TYPE=sqlite             # or postgres

# Database Options
DB_TYPE=sqlite             # Local development  
DB_TYPE=postgres           # Production with DATABASE_URL
```
